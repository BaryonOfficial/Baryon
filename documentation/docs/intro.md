# Introduction

Welcome to the Baryon technical documentation. This documentation provides comprehensive information about the architecture, implementation, and technical details of the Baryon audio visualization system.

## Overview

Baryon is a sophisticated real-time audio visualization system that combines advanced audio processing with GPU-accelerated physics simulations. The system processes audio input (either from files or microphone) and creates stunning visual representations using particle systems and acoustic physics principles.

## Documentation Structure

Our technical documentation is organized into three main sections:

### [System Architecture](/docs/technical/architecture)

The architecture documentation provides a high-level overview of the system, including:

- System components and their relationships
- Data flow between components
- System requirements and dependencies
- Framework integration points

### [Audio Analysis Pipeline](/docs/technical/audio-analysis)

Detailed documentation of the audio processing system:

- Audio input handling and processing
- Real-time frequency analysis
- Implementation details
- Framework migration guide

### [GPU Compute Pipeline](/docs/technical/gpu-compute)

Technical details of the GPU computation system:

- GPGPU implementation
- Shader computations
- Performance optimization
- Hardware considerations

## Getting Started

1. Start with the [System Architecture](/docs/technical/architecture) to understand the overall system design
2. Dive into specific components through the [Audio Analysis](/docs/technical/audio-analysis) or [GPU Compute](/docs/technical/gpu-compute) documentation
3. Follow the implementation guides for specific tasks
