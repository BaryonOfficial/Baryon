# Contributing to Baryon

Thank you for being part of the Baryon development team! This guide will help you understand our development process and contribution guidelines.

## Project Access

As Baryon is a private repository, ensure you have:

1. Been granted appropriate access to the repository
2. Signed any required NDAs or agreements (if applicable)
3. Received necessary development environment setup instructions

## Development Process

We use the OODA Loop framework to guide our development process:

- **Observe**: Understand the current state of the project, user needs, and technical requirements
- **Orient**: Analyze how your proposed changes fit into the larger project goals
- **Decide**: Choose the best approach for implementation
- **Act**: Execute your solution effectively

## How to Contribute

1. **Core Development**

   - Implement new features
   - Improve existing functionality
   - Optimize performance
   - Fix bugs and issues

2. **Documentation**

   - Update technical documentation
   - Create internal guides
   - Document APIs and components

## Development Workflow

1. Create your feature branch from `develop`

   - Branch naming convention: `feature/description` or `fix/description`
   - Example: `feature/add-3d-viz` or `fix/memory-leak`

2. Development Guidelines:

   - Write tests for new functionality (no tests have been written yet, but we should start writing them)
   - Ensure all tests pass locally
   - Follow the project's code style
   - Update documentation as needed

3. Code Review Process:
   - Create a pull request to `develop`
   - Request review from appropriate team members
   - Address review feedback
   - Maintain security best practices

## Git Commit Guidelines

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issue numbers in commit messages

Example commit messages:

- `fix: resolve memory leak, fixes #234`
- `feat: add new visualization, closes #567`
- `chore: update dependencies, resolves #890`

## Branch Structure

- `main`: Production-ready code
- `develop`: Primary development branch
- `feature/*`: New features
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*`: Urgent production fixes

## Issue and Pull Request Labels

- `priority-high`: Urgent issues needing immediate attention
- `bug`: Issues that are bugs
- `enhancement`: New feature requests
- `documentation`: Documentation updates
- `breaking-change`: Changes that affect backward compatibility

## Testing Requirements

- Run the test suite: `npm test` (doesn't exist yet)
- Ensure linting passes: `npm run lint`
- Check build succeeds: `npm run build`

## Getting Help

- Contact the project lead
- Create GitHub issues for technical discussions
- Use internal communication channels

## Security

- Do not share access to the repository
- Keep all project discussions internal
- Follow security best practices
- Report security concerns immediately to project leads

---

Remember that all project code and discussions should be kept confidential within the development team.
